      The term "milk" is an old chemistry term referring to a "heterogeneous mixture of insoluble compounds". "Colloid" is the modern term.
      Think "milk of magnesia", which is used as an antacid. It is called a milk because the Mg(OH)2 doesn't dissolve and just forms a suspension. Almond milk is a suspension of ground up almond particles. Cow milk is a suspension of fat particles that won't dissolve. This is why milk is homogenized: because it wants to form a floating fat layer and water layer. That's unappealing so they fake making it look the same throughout. It is not a homogeneous solution.
      So anything you can mix up in water that doesn't dissolve and it stays suspended is "milk".

      I ascribe to total liberation philosophy and also identify as an anarcho-communist. So many things that non-vegan leftists say about veganism is incorrect, but rather than address the same, hollow objections (excuses) levied by them, I will do my best to describe how leftism, particularly anarchism, necessitates ethical conclusions that align 1-to-1 with vegan ethics.
      The key dichotomy between left-wing and right-wing political philosophies is that left-wing values are centered around liberation from hierarchies. The more you are pro-liberation from various hierarchies, the more left-wing you are. Right-wing political philosophies value submission and subjugation to hierarchies.
      Anarchism is predicated upon being anti-hierarchy. A run-of-the-mill leftist generally would have to be anti-capitalist, but not necessarily anti-_all-hierarchies_, like an anarchist. However, non-anarchistic leftists would typically be against other hierarchies, such as: racism, sexism, transphobia, religious hierarchies, etc.
      What's interesting is that non-vegan leftists almost always arbitrarily make an exception by being completely fine with one hierarchy: speciesism. You cannot be "woke" (or, left-wing or a leftist) and still be in-favor of the hierarchy that allows animal exploitation. You are definitionally anti-liberation if you are okay participating in a voluntary hierarchy in which you are on-top exploiting those beneath you. Holistic liberation -- that is, liberation for everyone -- necessarily entails animal liberation. Anything short of that, any apologia made for the speciesist hierarchy that allows for their exploitation, should be an immediate ethical non-starter for any principled leftist.
      Additionally, veganism is more than a boycott, despite how badly non-vegan "leftists" prefer to categorize it as such. Primarily, as was stated in the video, it is a moral baseline; a non-action. You start from the shared belief that it is wrong to exploit someone if you can avoid doing so. We know that most people, barring extreme outlier circumstances, or more likely, _extremely-contrived carnist hypotheticals_, can avoid exploiting animals. From there, you can only conclude that you should cease participating in said system of exploitation, given that you do not need to continue supporting it.
      However, I do think there is a parallel between veganism and other successful boycott movements: its "success" (when viewed singularly as a boycott) requires supplementary activist strategies, such as the disruption of industry, protests, lobbying, etc.; something that _every single vegan pushes for_. If non-vegan leftists would prefer to reduce veganism from being a political movement that pushes toward total liberation, based upon anti-subjugation, pro-liberation ethical values, down to mere consumer-side activism, they are either uneducated on the reality of the vegan movement, or are being dishonest.
      You cannot be pro-liberation, an anarchist, or leftist of any kind if you are okay with interpersonal or systemic exploitation of anyone.
